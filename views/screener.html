                If you have ever been arrested, charged, convicted or had a warrant out in DC for a suspected violation
                of the DC code, you have a DC criminal record. The best way to determine whether you have a DC Criminal
                Record is to obtain a copy of your COMPLETE record from the Metropolitan Police Department and the
                Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

                YES! You will need a copy of your COMPLETE DC criminal record in order to answer the questions through
            this site. 

            A complete criminal record is made up of your arrest record that you can receive from the Police Department (MPD) AND your court record that you can receive from the DC Superior Court. You must have both records to continue as a judge will deny your request if you do not submit your complete cirminal record.

                              <p>Even though you are not eligible for sealing your criminal record, it is now against the law for an employer to ask you about your criminal record before they have provided you a conditional offer of employment. In 2014, The District of Columbia passed a law that prohibits employers (with 11 or more employees) from having a criminal background questions on a job application form, and ALSO prohibits an employer from asking about criminal convictions, arrests or accusations until after a conditional offer of employment has been made.</p> 

            <p>If someone ask you about your criminal history (before giving you a conditional offer) or if there is a question on the job application about your criminal history, you should immediatly file a complaint with the DC Office of Human Rights (OHR) <a href="http://ohr.dc.gov/page/returningcitizens">here</a> Compensation may be available to you if it is found that an employer you applied for a job with asked about your criminal history before making a condition offer of employment OR if they have a question on their employment application that asks if you have every committed a crime or been arrested.</p>
