    <h4>What does it mean to seal a DC Criminal Record?</h4>
    <p>
        If a DC criminal record is sealed, the government deletes or limits access to it. A sealed record can
        generally not be used against you if are applying for a job, in other background checks or in certain
        legal proceedings. Even after your DC criminal record is sealed, there are certain agencies and employers
        that CAN still see your record.
